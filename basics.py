#  How is Python interpreted?
## Python code is executed line by line at runtime. Python internally converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecode, which is then executed by the Python virtual machine (PVM).

# How do you manage memory in Python?
 ## Python uses automatic memory management and a garbage collector to handle memory. The garbage collector recycles memory when objects are no longer in use.


# List: Mutable, can be changed after creation.
# Tuple : Tuple: Immutable, cannot be changed after creation.
